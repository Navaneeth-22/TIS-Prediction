1)We have used svm,random forest and cnn as the models.
2)Make sure have all the above libraries.
3)Download the dataset.
4)Upload the dataset where the code is there.
5)Run each cell.
6) We can see all the prerocessed.
7)We can see all the features extracted.We can see all the features Extracted in ipynb file after running the cell.
8) We can see pca features reduction.
9)We later run svm and random forest we see the accuracy and confusion matrix.
10)We can also see the predicted class of the two sequences.
11)We can later run the cnn.
12)We can see accuracy,loss ,precision of each epoch.
13)We later compared the accuracys of three models
